# About Localization

Recently there was a question on Facebook about content localization. It's one of those features that work really well as long as you know how :-)

So, here's the run down. 

Step 1: add the language of your choosing.
This resides under Settings - Site settings - Languages. Hit the link 'add language'


Step 2: verify that the language is enabled. This is marked with a check mark. If not, use the cog icon to enable the language.


Step 3: Enable Content localization. Mind you that this sets the default language which can not be changed afterwards. 


Step 4: you can now visit your pages and start localizing content. As an admin, you'll find the language switcher most of the time (depending on the theme) at the right top of your screen.

Step 5: Mark your translated page as 'translated' and give it a go (if you desire) to be published. This resides under the page settings - localization.


And...nope, still no language switcher for visitors...

The last step is to activate your language. Go back to your languages (Settings - Site settings - language tab) and find the icon that (very few people know) stands for multi language.


There you activate your pages.


Now, this last step is one that a lot of us have been searching for ages...why does my content not show? So, here's why.

Although, it seems like a bit of overkill, it makes sense. It allows you as a content manager to prepare all the work for a new language and publish after everyone involved has approved. 

If this still does not show your translated content, verify if you are using a module that needs language activation as well.

Happy localizing!
